# Hello

I'm a Tech Lead and Product Strategist with over 20 years experience

I've built applications in **Umbraco**, **Optimizely**, **Drupal**, and **Wordpress**, and old rogues like DotNetNuke and Immediacy. 
I've even made some sites in SharePoint, but I don't like to talk about it. 

Iâ€™ve advised clients such as Primark, the Houses of Parliament, Dixons, the NHS, BP, and New Balance on their technical and digital strategies.

Most of all, I am **bold** in my thinking, and listen closely to my heart.

## A bit about me

Over the past 20 years, I've had the pleasure of working with some fantastic clients, and some fantastic people.
