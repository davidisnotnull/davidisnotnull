# Salut!

I'm a **Technology Consultant** and **Product Strategist** with over two decades of experience. 

I offer extensive expertise across a wide range of technologies and product solutions, supported by my understanding of people and their needs.

Iâ€™ve advised clients such as Primark, the Houses of Parliament, the Ministry of Justice, Dixons, the NHS, BP and New Balance on their product strategy and technical solutions.

Most of all, I am **bold** in my thinking, and listen closely to my heart.

## A bit about me

Over the past 2 and a half decades, I've had the pleasure of working with some fantastic clients, and some fantastic people.

Some of my clients include:

* Hackney Council
* Nexer Group
* MSP Marketing Edge
* Primark
* Houses of Parliament
* The NHS
* Zoopla
* Marie Curie
* The Royal College of Physicians
* Currys PC World
* Milk & More
* The Ministry of Justice
* New Balance
* GKN

### Here's what I know
In case you're interested in the technologies that I'm familiar with

* In depth knowledge of C#, MVC, Entity Framework, and coding to SOLID standards
* Experienced with .NET Core
* Excellent understanding of Web APIs and associated design structure, particularly creating service providers for front-end consumption and SPAs
* Front end frameworks, using webpack and Vue.js 2.x and 3.x
* Mobile application development using Xamarin
* PHP, but only in an emergency these days

## But wait, there's more!

It's always nice to have some things to start a conversation with.

* I'm a Lord of the Principality of Sealand
* I'm a qualified therapist with a few hundred hours of client contact time, so happy to talk about any personal problems you're going through. Be warned, I will invoice you afterwards.
* I run a Meditation School called [Maitri Meditation School](https://maitrimeditationschool.org).
* I'm a practising Buddhist, and have taken refuge with His Holiness Khenchen Lama Rinpoche. I only wear robes on special occasions though - I feel they're a bit dramatic for an office environment.
* I've written a book on philosophy and psychology that you can [buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Observing-Guide-Living-More-Authentic-ebook/dp/B0D54FV5D5/)
* I have a podcast called *The Observing I*, where I talk about philosophy, psychology, and the human condition. [Go give it a listen](https://patreon.com/theobservingi/)
* I like the Oxford comma (see above)
