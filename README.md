# Salut!

I'm a Tech Lead and Product Strategist with over 2 decades of experience

I've built applications in **Umbraco**, **Optimizely**, **Drupal**, and **Wordpress**, and old rogues like DotNetNuke and Immediacy. 
I've even made some sites in SharePoint, but I don't like to talk about it. 

Iâ€™ve advised clients such as Primark, the Houses of Parliament, Dixons, the NHS, BP, and New Balance on their technical and digital strategies.

Most of all, I am **bold** in my thinking, and listen closely to my heart.

## A bit about me

Over the past 20 years, I've had the pleasure of working with some fantastic clients, and some fantastic people.

Some of my clients include:

* Nexer Group
* Primark
* Houses of Parliament
* The NHS
* Zoopla
* Marie Curie
* The Royal College of Physicians
* Currys PC World
* Milk & More
* The Ministry of Justice
* New Balance
* GKN

### Here's what I know
In case you're interested in the technologies that I'm familiar with

* In depth knowledge of C#, MVC, Entity Framework, and coding to SOLID standards
* Experienced with .NET Core
* Excellent understanding of Web APIs and associated design structure, particularly creating service providers for front-end consumption and SPAs
* Front end frameworks, using webpack and Vue.js 2.x and 3.x
* Mobile application development using Xamarin
* PHP, but only in an emergency these days

## But wait, there's more!

It's always nice to have some things to start a conversation with

* I'm a Lord of the Principality of Sealand
* I'm a qualified therapist and life coach, so happy to talk about any personal problems you're going through. But I will invoice you afterwards.
* I run a wellbeing and mentoring organisation called [Fruitful Success](https://fruitfulsuccess.com).
* I'm a practising Buddhist, and have taken refuge with His Holiness Khenchen Lama Rinpoche. I only wear robes on special occasions though - I feel they're a bit dramatic for an office environment.
* I have a podcast called *The Observing I*, where I talk about mental health things and self-development. Go give it a listen - [https://open.spotify.com/show/1yyZ9oUA1hQgjFVePal5Xn](https://open.spotify.com/show/1pZOApzbayt5RzGV3XTqL6)
* I write on Substack about mental health and my personal journey of (supposed) self-improvement, which you can find here https://theobservingi.substack.com/
